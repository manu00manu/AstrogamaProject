    <h1>Scorpio</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Scorpio is the eighth sign of the zodiac (October 23–November 21), and it's represented by the scorpion. A fixed water sign ruled by Pluto in modern astrology and Mars in ancient astrology, Scorpio (or Vrishchika in Vedic astrology) energy is mystical and mysterious.

        Here, we'll dive into the personality traits of Scorpio and explore how this sign approaches life, love, career, and more.</p>

    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Scorpio personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Scorpionic energy often appears calm and subdued but is intensely emotional underneath the surface.

        We can begin to understand the depths of Scorpio by looking at Pluto—its ruling planet that is associated with the underworld, death, and rebirth. We meet with Pluto in our lives when we feel we need to cross a threshold, examine deep emotional processes, or find truth by delving deep into the hidden parts of ourselves.
        
        Scorpio is a fixed sign, meaning Scorpios tend to like stability, routines, and home life—just like their opposite sign, Taurus. We can think of Taurus as the natural world and all that is visible and Scorpio as the underworld, or whatever emotions, thoughts, truths, and secrets linger below the surface. 
        
        Scorpio is often associated with the eighth house in astrology—an arena that rules sex, death, and rebirth, among other things.
        
        Scorpios are famously discreet and even secretive, with an air of mystery around them. Other personality traits include fearlessness, boldness (thanks to Mars), passion, creativity, and fierce loyalty. </p>

    <h2>Scorpio challenges & opportunities for growth.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Scorpio's depth can create tunnel vision at times, and this is a sign that can be a tad obsessive. This means that Scorpio could take a cue from another fixed sign, Aquarius, and zoom out to get the wide-angle view once in a while.

        Another major opportunity for growth involves letting things go. Scorpios tend to hold onto grudges, negative energy, or obsessive thought patterns about people or situations that have wronged them. Remember that grudges only hurt the grudge-keeper.
        
        Finally, Scorpios would do well to remember that their friends, partners, and co-workers are not mind-readers. They should always remember to communicate emotions and talk about how they're feeling. Don't keep all of those secrets inside, Scorpio! Let them out to let them go. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Scorpio in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>It can be hard to "read" a new Scorpio friend at first, and they may come off as aloof, mysterious, or unemotive. But don't be fooled: There's a lot stirring beneath the surface! Like their namesake, the Scorpion, Scorpios are slow and steady but will sting when threatened.

        If you cross a Scorpio, prepare to get that stinger. The shadowy side of this sign involves holding grudges, keeping secrets, and seeking revenge. 
        
        If they trust you, though, they'll be an honest, dedicated, and loyal friend who is always there to lean on and tell secrets to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Scorpio in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Scorpios love hanging out in the dimly lit regions of the subconscious and can often make wonderful therapists, astrologers, tarot readers, or guides of any sort. Likewise, any career that involves research or in-depth analysis is Scorpionic territory. Additionally, the eighth house rules other people's finances, so financial adviser is another possible career option for our Scorpio friends.

        Scorpio likes to go deep, and they can focus on one task or subject for a while, even obsessively at times.
        
        Scorpio energy is also associated with all things "taboo" or not socially acceptable. This means that Scorpios are the ones that everyone in the office runs to with their most personal, unspeakable problems and secrets. 
        
        As mentioned above, Scorpios are immensely loyal, often staying with one company or profession for their whole lives. They're not into gossiping or pettiness and often have magnetic personalities that co-workers and clients are drawn to.</p>

    <h2>Scorpio compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, but Scorpios typically gravitate toward folks who can help them understand the deepest and most true parts of human nature—and tear down societal taboos along the way. Here are their most compatible and incompatible signs in friendship and love. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Scorpio friendships and romantic relationships are fellow water signs (Cancer, other Scorpios, and Pisces), as they speak the same emotional language, and earth signs (Virgo, Taurus, Capricorn), who they appreciate for their stability and groundedness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>
        Air signs (Gemini, Aquarius, Libra) tend to be a little too flighty for ultra-intense Scorpio, while fire signs (Aries, Sagittarius, Leo) might bring sexual chemistry but not much long-term potential. </p>

    <h2><bold>Summary</bold></h2>
