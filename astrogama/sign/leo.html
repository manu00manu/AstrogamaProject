    <h1>Leo</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac (July 22 to August 23), and it's represented by the lion. A fixed fire sign ruled by the sun, Leo (called Simha in Vedic astrology) has energy that is glamorous, courageous, and bold. Here, we'll dive into the personality traits of Leo and explore how this sign approaches life, love, career, and more.</p>

    <h2>Leo personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Leos tend to be full of primal, creative energy. This is a sign that embodies the fire that lives within us all.

        Leo's ruler, the sun, teaches us all we need to know about this bright sign: In astrology, the sun symbolizes the fuel, energy, and vital life force that powers all the other planets. Whereas the moon illuminates only some things, the sun shines upon everything—giving us life and light in the process.
        
        The sign of Leo wants to see and be seen, just like the sun that rules it, which is why Leo is associated with visibility, attention, courage, generosity, and creative impulses.
        
        Leo's symbol, the lion, is equally telling: Lions are the kings of the jungle, known for their fierce courage and natural regality. It's all about attention—the giving and receiving of light and energy—for this zodiac sign.</p>

    <p>There is, of course, a shadow side to all of this energy and light.

        As with most fire signs, Leos are susceptible to burnout after long days basking in the limelight. Leos would do well to make sure they're resting, relaxing, and recharging as needed.
        
        Additionally, Leos are often perceived as being self-centered; the sun sits at the center of the sky, after all. Taking time to help others and remember that the world doesn't revolve around them (even if they want it to) is a good idea for this sign.
        
        Finally, Leos can be easily offended if they feel they're not getting enough attention. In those moments, they should remind themselves that they have a wealth of inner light and life that they can pull from. The sun shines on everyone generously, and Leos, at their best, do the same. If a Leo is feeling "unseen," they should shine their light on others and they'll get it right back in return. </p>

    <h2>Leo in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p> Typically, Leos are the life of the party, and they need a huge friend group that feels more like an audience.

        Leo rules the heart, and a great gift of this sign is being able to light up a room—uplifting everyone in it. There is an element of worship in everything Leo does. Lions are able to find the elements of people that are worth holding in high esteem and making them feel special and unique. Leos need this same kind of attention in return, so be sure to let your Leo friends know how special they are.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Leo in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Since they like to move between realms, the typical Gem is likely to have several streams of income—often from gigs that involve journalism, the arts, travel, or astrology. (Mercury, Gemini's ruler, is the ruler of astrology itself!)

        A job with some level of socializing is typically necessary for a Gemini. Whether working with clients one-on-one or in larger groups as a community organizer, Gemini likes to get out into the world and learn about people.
        
        If a Gemini does have a steady 9-to-5 job, they're likely the one in the office who's always mixing things up by planning parties, gossiping at the watering hole, and surprising the staff with treats. 
        
        At their best, Geminis are excellent talkers and listeners: They make office conversation a true art form and are quick to learn from anyone and everyone they come in contact with.  </p>

    <h2>Leo compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, but Leos tend to gravitate toward folks who can make them feel seen and heard. Here are their most compatible and incompatible signs in friendship and love.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Leo friendships and romantic relationships are fellow fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) as they'll match their passion and heat. Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) also have dynamic, fast-paced energy and could work well for a Leo. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Water signs (Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio) and earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) might be more difficult for this sign to relate to, as their down-to-earth nature doesn't lend itself to the glitz and drama Leos crave.</p>
