    <h1>Cancer</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac (June 21–July 21), and it's represented by the crab. A cardinal water sign ruled by the moon, Cancer (called Karkata in Vedic astrology) energy is emotional, homey, and comforting. Here, we'll dive into the personality traits of Cancer and explore how this sign approaches life, love, career, and more.</p>

    <h2>Cancer personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Cancer is often associated with home, roots, and our emotional lives.

        Those born under this sign are often quite sensitive, able to perceive other people's feelings and moods. Cancers also tend to be very in tune with their environments. Like the moon mirrors the light of the sun, this sign can reflect the energy of the world around them.
        
        In astrology, the moon also speaks to the home: where we came from, our roots, and how we recharge. So feeling at home is often very important for typical Cancerians, as is having time for rest and reflection. (Think of the crab retreating into its shell.)
        
        Finally, as a cardinal water sign, Cancer is associated with beginnings, origins, and the waters of the womb. This sign is all about growth, nourishment, and comfort. How do we feel at home in our bodies, in the universe, in our communities? How do we connect to our lineage? These are all Cancer questions.</p>

    <h2>Cancer challenges & opportunities for growth.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Cancers have a lot of feelings, which can be beautiful—but there's also a shadow side to all of this sensitivity: Cancers can feel easily offended, wounded, and hurt.

        Teasing or criticism that might go unnoticed by other signs could send a Cancer into an emotional crisis. Many Cancers need to learn that in order to preserve their energy and mental health, it's best to not take things personally.
        
        Remember that crab shell? Well, the urge for Cancers is often to retreat into their shells instead of face the world. For this ultra-sensitive sign, a major opportunity for growth involves learning to express their feelings to others.
        
        Since many Cancers tend to avoid confrontation or what they perceive as drama, they can come off as passive-aggressive—dropping hints that they're hurt rather than making their emotions clear. Instead of assuming that other people know why they're upset, this sign needs to learn to communicate openly, honestly, and often.</p>

    <h2>Cancer in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Typically, Cancers need a few ride-or-die friends that feel like family. The Cancerian in your friend group is most likely the one opening their home to people and creating a welcoming environment for all.

        Like the moon, which orbits the earth, Cancers have the truly wonderful gift of being able to tune into people and their environments, so this is a friend that can often see through a facade and perceive what those in their circle are really feeling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Cancer in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>As in most areas of their lives, the typical Cancerian needs to feel secure at work. A steady income and a clear job trajectory are essential for their mental and emotional health.

        Because of their excellent listening skills and genuine interest in people, Cancers tend to do well as therapists, bodyworkers, energy healers, or in any profession where listening, intuition, and care are involved. Cancers are also known to work well with children, so they'll likely thrive in any profession that involves taking care of kids and/or families.
        
        No matter their chosen profession, Cancer will make those around them feel nurtured, cared for, and seen. </p>

    <h2>Cancer compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, but Cancers typically gravitate toward folks who can make them feel seen and cared for. Here are their most compatible and incompatible signs in friendship and love:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Cancer friendships and romantic relationships are fellow water signs, Pisces and Scorpio, as they'll just "get it" with regards to the emotional language that Cancer speaks. Earth signs (Virgo, Taurus, and Capricorn) have similar space-holding energy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius) and air signs (Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius) might be more difficult, as they tend to have a harder time tending to the sensitivity of Cancer. Cancer could prove easily wounded by their intensity.  </p>
