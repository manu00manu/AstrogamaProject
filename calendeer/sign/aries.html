    <h1>Aries</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Aries is the first sign of the zodiac (March 21 to April 20), and its mascot is the Ram. As a fire sign ruled by the planet Mars, Aries (called Mesha in Vedic astrology) energy is individualistic, bold, and brave.

        Here, we're diving into Aries' personality traits and how they apply in love, career, and more.</p>

    <h2>Aries personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries folks like to initiate and dive headfirst (like a Ram) into whatever it is they're passionate about.

        This is partly due to their planetary ruler, Mars. As the planet of desire, action, war, and heat, Mars is responsible for lots of the traits we associate with our Aries friends.
        
        As a Cardinal fire sign, Aries also likes to be on the move and travels a zillion miles an hour. It can be hard to keep up with an impassioned and empowered Aries.
        
        Think about the amount of boldness, risk, confidence, and sheer energy and life force it takes to start any kind of project or phase in life. That's all Aries.
        
        The Aries archetype is also about the passion and innocence of youth. As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries leaps in horns-first and asks questions about it later. This fiery Aries energy can be inspiring, energetic, ferocious—and a little intimidating.</p>

    <h2>Aries challenges & opportunities for growth.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>One word: burnout. The Aries fire blazes fierce and bright, but it's fast fuel that needs to be fanned, fed, and nurtured. Remember to slow down, listen to your body, and know that you don't have to do everything with lightning-quick speed, Aries!

        Mars, Aries' planetary ruler, is always in conversation with Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and art. A helpful hint for Aries is to sink into this Venusian energy once in a while and remember that leisure, beauty, and sensuality are just as important as speed, passion, and winning.
        
        The adage, "Think before you speak; look before you leap," is a helpful reminder for ultrapowerful Aries energy. Like the ram butting its head up against the wall, Aries too can get caught in frustrating cycles of negativity.
        
        Relax, slow down, and think about what you really want to say and do before acting.
        
        Remember that sometimes, simply being can be a kind of action, Aries.</p>

    <h2>Aries in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>If you want an up-front friend to tell it like it is, look no further than your closest Aries comrade, as they'll have no problem giving you their two-cents.

        They're also great friends to have if you're looking for excitement and adventure. They are quite spontaneous, so just make sure you're ready to go and can keep up with their non-stop energy.
        
        These people make friends easily, though it's not uncommon for them to lose touch or bounce around friend groups, as they like to keep things interesting and experience new things.
        
        Even if you two have the occasional spat (Aries can have a bit of a temper), they can also get over it easily as they're typically loyal and value their friendships. They do, however, expect that loyalty to be returned to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Aries in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>As in love and romance, independence is a keyword for Aries in matters of career and money. Aries folks aren't known for taking orders well, preferring to be their own bosses.

        Aries can also make excellent leaders. Heading up a team of people, they encourage risk-taking, pioneering vision, and fearlessness.
        
        An ideal career for this sign is anything that allows them to use their fiery fuel to fight for a cause they believe in and/or something that involves athleticism or physicality. (Mars is bodily and likes to move.)
        
        Aries is equally well-suited to freelancing or independent contracting, as the DIY life fits the sign's autonomous temperament.
        
        The challenge for Aries is staying committed. This fire sign loves to start projects but not necessarily finish them. Over the course of their careers, Aries folks will need to figure out what truly makes their inner light shine and how they can best keep it burning. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Aries compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, and Aries can make it work with anyone who shares their passionate energy. That being said, Aries typically craves partners and friends who will appreciate their indie nature and who also have full, busy lives of their own.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Aries for friendship and romantic relationships are Libra (sometimes, opposites attract), Sagittarius, and Leo (fellow fire signs will speak their same passionate language).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Aries can tend to butt heads against Cancers, as these water signs tend to take things personally—a danger when you're dating or befriending a fierce Ram like Aries.

        An Aries-Capricorn match can also sometimes be tough, as Aries does not want to be restricted or restrained. Above all, Aries likes a challenge and needs the space and freedom to be themselves. </p>
