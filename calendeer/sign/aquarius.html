    <h1>Aquarius</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac (January 20 to February 18). It's represented by the Water Bearer, or sometimes simply by 
        three squiggly lines (hence why many people mistake Aquarius for a water sign).
        A fixed air sign ruled by Saturn in ancient astrology, and Uranus in modern astrology, Aquarius (called Kumbha in Vedic astrology) energy is eclectic, creative, and forward-thinking.
        Here, we'll dive into the personality traits of Aquarius and explore how this sign approaches life, love, career, and more.</p>

    <h2>Aquarius personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Just as with any sign, there are many ways to be an Aquarius. However, this sign is known to have an affinity for the unknown—and what may seem "experimental" or "avant-garde" to the rest of us.

        It's truly a sign ahead of the times, and Aquarians are always looking forward into the future with a cool, airy perspective. As such, they're sometimes labeled as the archetypal outsiders or eclectics of the zodiac.
        
        Aquarius is represented by the Water Bearer—a figure emptying a jug of water. This gesture is meant to sweep away the past, clear away stagnant thinking that's holding us back, and make room for what's next. This says a lot about the Aquarian personality.
        
        Ruled by Saturn and Uranus, the Aquarian superpower involves reflecting on the past while figuring out how to move forward into the future. Saturn is the planet of time and also the ruler of Capricorn. Uranus, discovered around the same time as electricity, is the planet of insights, revelations, and revolutions.
        
        In the Northern Hemisphere, Aquarius season comes in the middle of winter. Think of it as a cool blast of wintry air that can help us find clarity, revelation, and sudden electrical insights.
        
        Aquarius' opposite sign is Leo, the theatrical fire sign. These two energies are in constant conversation. If Leo brings on the personal creative fire, Aquarius shows us how to use that fuel to power the future.
        
        Aquarians are usually full of ideas, ready to get the big picture on a problem and figure out how we should all move forward collectively into the unknown. Aquarius says onward—into the future!</p>

    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Aquarians are the cool air of winter, filled with revelatory insights. However, that cool air can be a tad aloof at times.

        Aquarius prefers "we" to "me," and unlike their opposite sign of Leo, isn't very comfortable in the limelight. But as with most signs, Aquarians can learn a lot from their opposer. It's OK to take center stage, warm up to people, and let your guard down sometimes, Aquarius!</p>

    <h2>Aquarius in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Since air signs tend to be quite cerebral, Aquarians are typically looking for friends they can connect with intellectually. They're always on the hunt for people they can really think through life with.

        Their Uranus rulership makes them charmed by new information or anything that's surprising to them: Music, art, and discoveries that fall outside the mainstream are all ways into the Aquarian heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Aquarius in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Aquarians are the inventors, scientists, experimental artists, and artisans of the zodiac.

        Uranus, Aquarius' ruling planet, is associated with newness and invention. Likewise, Aquarians often feel most at home in fields that are on the brink of discoveries. Ethical technology, electronic music, and visionary inventions all fall under this sign's wheelhouse.
        
        The typical Aquarian is not just in business for themselves—they're always pondering what's best for humanity and the collective. This means the sign will feel most fulfilled in jobs that put sustainability, the future of the planet, and collective harmony at the forefront.
        
        Additionally, Aquarians often thrive in groups, where they can bounce ideas back and forth, try new things, and experiment. Aquarians know that a few heads are better than one. </p>

    <h2>Aquarius compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, but Aquarians typically gravitate toward folks who can help them with their big-picture thinking. Here are their most compatible and incompatible signs in friendship and love:</p>

    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Aquarius friendships and romantic relationships are fellow air signs (Aquarius, Libra, Gemini), as they speak the same intellectual language, and fire signs (Leo, Sagittarius, Aries).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) and earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) might find themselves intrigued by Aquarians but aren't typically built for long-term relationships with the water bearer. </p>
