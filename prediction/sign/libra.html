    <h1>Libra</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac (September 23–October 22) and is represented by the scales of justice. A cardinal air sign ruled by Venus, Libra (or Tula, in Vedic astrology) is often associated with justice, balance, beauty, and harmony.

        Here, we'll dive into the personality traits of Libra and explore how this sign approaches life, love, career, and more.</p>

    <h2>Libra personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Let's start to unpack the sign of Libra through its ruling planet Venus, which controls love, harmony, and art. In Libra, Venus' energy manifests as a desire to merge, compromise, and create balance. After Virgo sorts through the harvest, Libra enters to weigh what's been gathered and figure out how to distribute it fairly and equitably.

        Libras are interested in finding balance everywhere: in spheres of social justice, friendships, partnerships, etc. As such, they're often stereotyped as being indecisive—but they're just weighing all the options. The scales of justice are meticulous, after all.
        
        Libra's opposite sign, Aries, is known for boldness. Libra, on the other hand, prefers to keep the peace, so you may have heard that Libras are nonconfrontational.
        
        Like the other air signs, Aquarius and Gemini, Libra is interested in ideas and ideals—in finding social order and pointing out injustices and inequities along the way. This makes Libras essential players in our current cultural moment. They're the ones asking: What is justice? What is fair? Who is being left out? 
        
        Famously design-savvy and aesthetically attuned, Libras also place a lot of importance on maintaining a beautiful environment.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Libras weigh the pros and cons of everything. On one hand, this can be wonderful. On the other, it can be quite tiring and leave Libras with decision fatigue. This is a sign that would do well to remember everyone makes mistakes—and they don't have to be the end of the world. Breathe, trust your gut, and move forward with confidence.

        Additionally, Libras can be so focused on helping others keep the peace that they don't always stand up for themselves. It's important for them to vocalize when their feelings are hurt instead of sweeping everything under the rug. It's OK to rock the boat in your personal life sometimes, Libra. </p>

    <h2>Libra in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p> Your Libra friend is likely a conversational wiz who can hold court in all kinds of social situations. Like all air signs, Libra is socially curious and always interested in the ways humans interact and think.

        The typical Libra likes to keep an eye on what's fair and does their best to remain impartial, hearing all sides of arguments, not jumping to conclusions or reacting out of anger. They know all arguments have several sides, and they're curious to hear them.
        
        This sign is also famously flexible and happy to let their partner or friends make the decisions about where to go and what to do.</p>

    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Libra in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>As a Venus-ruled, balance-oriented sign, it should come as no surprise that typical Libran careers involve mediation, fighting for what they believe in, and the arts. Popular jobs for this sign include anything in the law, design, or HR realms.

        Whatever profession Libras find themselves in, they'll often take on the role of mediator. This means when anyone at the office needs to settle a dispute or figure out what's fair, Libras usually come to the rescue.
        
        They possess the superpower of being able to see things from multiple sides. And unfortunately, this can lead to a heavy dose of indecision and anxiousness. Libras like to be liked and will find it hard to brush it off if someone takes issue with a decision they've made around the office.
        
        Libras are also famously charming both in and out of the office, thanks to their Venus rulership and that sociable air sign energy. Client acquisition, wining and dining, and customer service are all in Libra's wheelhouse.</p>

    <h2>Libra compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, but Libras typically gravitate toward folks who can help them fight for what's right. Here are their most compatible and incompatible signs in friendship and love.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Libra friendships and romantic relationships are fellow air signs (Gemini, Aquarius, and other Libras) as they speak the same airy language. Though there may be obstacles along the way, Libra can match well with opposing sign Aries, and these two stand to learn a lot from each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) tend to be a little too emotional for the typical Libra's tastes, while earth signs (Virgo, Taurus, Capricorn) might perceive sociable Libra as flighty or fickle.</p>
