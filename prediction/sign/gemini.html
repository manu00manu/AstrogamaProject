    <h1>Gemini</h1>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Gemini is the third sign of the zodiac (May 21 to June 20), and it's symbolized by the twins. As a mutable air sign ruled by the planet Mercury, Gemini (called Mithuna in Vedic astrology) is chatty, curious, and cerebral. Here, we're diving into all things Gemini and exploring how this sign tends to approach life, love, career, and more.</p>

    <h2>Gemini personality traits.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Mercury, the ruler of Gemini, is the planet of communication, language, and travel. Mercury is named for the only Roman god who could travel freely between the underworld and the heavens, explaining Gemini's desire to maneuver between realms, chat with all kinds of folks, and run after their curiosities.

        Gemini is represented by two people talking back and forth (the twins) in constant conversation, further reinforcing that this is a social sign with an affinity for gossip and a strong need for mental and physical stimulation. As an air sign, Gemini is also associated with the mind and knowledge.
        
        Geminis form connections through dialogue, communication, debate, and questions. Like the ever-curious child constantly asking Why?, Geminis like to pick things apart to understand them. They're also verbal wizards, tending to have a knack for relating to people through language and maneuvering seamlessly between social spheres.
        
        In the Northern Hemisphere, Gemini season happens when spring is turning to summer. It's a transitional period, and this is a movable, flexible sign that likes to multitask.</p>

    <h2>Gemini challenges & opportunities for growth.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>An opportunity for growth for our Gemini friends includes watching what they say—and to whom they say it. Gemini's desire to spread the word can get them into trouble, and this sign is often stereotyped as being gossipy and flirty. Learning what information is theirs to tell and what is better kept under wraps is a lifelong challenge for this sign. 

        Geminis can also benefit from slowing down, staying present, and getting grounded. As a Mercury-ruled air sign that's constantly on the move, Gemini can sometimes miss the slow and simple pleasures that one notices by simply being. 
        
        While adventuring and socializing typically come naturally to Geminis, relaxing proves more difficult. Practices like breathwork, meditation, and yoga will prove extra beneficial for Geminis looking to calm their buzzing energy. </p>

    <h2>Gemini in friendship.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p> As the quintessential multitasker of the zodiac, Gemini is easily bored. Typically, they seek out lots of friends from many different circles. The freedom to roam between social networks is a must for this sign.

        The Gemini in your friend group is likely the one raising the conversational bar, encouraging everyone to break out of their boring routines, and introducing different friend groups to one another.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h2>Gemini in career & money.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Since they like to move between realms, the typical Gem is likely to have several streams of income—often from gigs that involve journalism, the arts, travel, or astrology. (Mercury, Gemini's ruler, is the ruler of astrology itself!)

        A job with some level of socializing is typically necessary for a Gemini. Whether working with clients one-on-one or in larger groups as a community organizer, Gemini likes to get out into the world and learn about people.
        
        If a Gemini does have a steady 9-to-5 job, they're likely the one in the office who's always mixing things up by planning parties, gossiping at the watering hole, and surprising the staff with treats. 
        
        At their best, Geminis are excellent talkers and listeners: They make office conversation a true art form and are quick to learn from anyone and everyone they come in contact with.  </p>

    <h2>Gemini compatible signs.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>There are no absolutes when it comes to astrological compatibility, but Geminis typically gravitate toward folks who can fulfill their need for intriguing conversation. Here are their most compatible and incompatible signs in friendship and love.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Compatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Generally, the most compatible signs for Gemini friendships and romantic relationships are fellow air signs Aquarius and Libra, as they'll have an innate understanding of Gemini's mental nature. Fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius) are similarly energetic and can match well with our Gemini friends. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_h">
    <h3>Incompatible signs:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text_p">
    <p>Geminis tend to have less in common with water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces). While water signs crave emotional connection and comfort, Geminis need movement and stimulation.</p>
